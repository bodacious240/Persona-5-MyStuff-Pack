Dev version of my mod for MKW. Get full releases in its [Gamebanana page](https://gamebanana.com/mods/580962).
Only files that are different from latest release are included (excluding .d folders).

No brstm or brsar files are included due to file size.
In order to use with Wheel Wizard, make a new mod folder with a higher priority than the latest release.
